# project-cycling-CTL
Using cycling training data to predict an athletes fitness over time using a different machine learning models.

## Project Aim
The main goal of this project is to gain a surface level understanding of the workflow of deploying a machine learning model.

## TODO:

### Data Engineering
- [X] Wrangle Data
   - [X] Create pipeline
   - [X] Dataframe conversion -> Direct conversion (20x faster)
   - [ ] Convert from CSV storage to Relational Database storage
- [ ] Clean Data
- [ ] Exploratory Analysis

### Machine Learning
- [ ] Make a itterative model class
- [ ] Predict

### Software
- [ ] Deploy (somehow)
